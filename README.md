## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This application must allow the management of the tasks to be performed, including their creation, modification, deletion and categorization.

### Prerequisites

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Code Editor
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Server Enviroment

### Prerequisites
This application is composed of two repositories, it is necessary that the backend located in [press here](https://github.com/johnnycastro72/final-project-be) is installed and running to be able to run this frontend.

### Installing

Download and install all tools and frameworks on your local desktop and select a directory to clone this repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/johnnycastro72/final-project-be
cd final-project-fe
npm install
npm run dev
```

### And coding style tests

This project was developed using react as the main library and [vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) was used to create the structure of this, folders were created for components and state management, the paradigm is functional and javascript was used.

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

The design is intuitive and I invite you to use it and all your comments will be very welcome.

## üöÄ Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system.

## ‚õèÔ∏è Built Using <a name = "built_using"></a>

- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Server Environment
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) - JavaScript programming language
- [Vitejs](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) - is a build tool.
